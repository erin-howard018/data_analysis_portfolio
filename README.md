This section contains brief descriptions of the projects data analytics I have undertaken. 

### Project 1: Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study (Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone Project).

- **Aim:** This analysis is a capstone project case study, the final part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. For this case study, assume the real-world position of a junior data analyst on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago and aimed to analyse data to give insight into designing a new marketing strategy that will convert casual raiders into annual members.
- **Data Source:** Publicly available dataset (12 months of data) which can be accessed [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)
- **Description:** 12 individual .csv files combined to create one large dataset that recorded Cyclistic bike rides across a 12 month period. The project includes the following steps: data importing, tranformation, cleaning, EDA (exploratory data analysis), visualisation, presentation of findings and recommendations based on findings.   
- **Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualisation.  
- **Tools:** Excel, R and PowerBI.  
- **Results:** Comparison of rider-type groups across variables, exploration of relationships in the data, data-driven business recommendations.

- **Aim:** This is a personal data analysis project that I have undertaken because I was interested in tracking my runs in my journey for training for my half-marathon later this year. In the future I want to continue to work on this Excel spreadsheet to make it more sophisticated as I learn what kind of tracking data is useful for my training.  
- **Data Source:** Self recorded data
- **Description:** The Excel file contains 3 worksheets; one where you are inputting data about your run, another that calculates statistics across weeks and another that tracks and forecasts statistics by months.
- **Skills:** spreadsheet design, data analysis, data visualisation.  
- **Tools:** Excel. 
- **Results:** Automatically updating tracking spreadsheet that calculates summary statistics and future forecasts.
